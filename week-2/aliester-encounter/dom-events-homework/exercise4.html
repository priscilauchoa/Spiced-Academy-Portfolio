<!-- 
Make a page that has on it an element that is 200px by 200px in size and has a solid background color. Nest within that element another element that is 50px by 50px in size and has a different solid background color. When the user clicks on the outer element its background color should change to a randomly selected color. However, if the user clicks on the inner element, the inner element's background color should change to a randomly selected background color but the outer element's background color should not change at all. -->
